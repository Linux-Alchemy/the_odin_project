  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>Behold, the pulled pork sandwich: a golden bun, toasted with the optimism of a lottery winner, cradling a haystack
    of slow-cooked pork that’s surrendered into tender, sauce-slicked strands. Atop, a tousled mop of purple cabbage
    slaw winks like a punk rocker at a garden party, while two pert pickle spears stand guard—dill-scented sentinels
    against blandness. The whole affair looms on its plate like a delicious act of rebellion against hunger.</p>

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 soft brioche bun (toasted, with delusions of grandeur)</li>
    <li>300g pulled pork (slow cooked until it begs for mercy)</li>
    <li>handful of purple cabbage slaw (crisp, tart, and slightly rebellious)</li>
    <li>2 dill pickle spears (standing to attention like sour faced butlers)</li>
    <li>Generous glug of BBQ sauce (sticky, smokey and unapologetic)</li>
    <li>Knob of butter (optional, but really, why wouldn't you?)</li>
    <li>Pinch of patience (for the slow cooker, or a take away cheat)</li>
  </ul>


  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Slow-cook the pork shoulder in barbecue sauce until it collapses like a politician’s promise—roughly 6 hours on
      low, or cheat with pre-shredded from the deli if time’s against you.</li>
    <li>Butter and toast the brioche bun until it’s golden and smug, humming with self-importance.</li>
    <li>Pile the pulled pork high in the bottom bun, forming a carnivorous haystack that defies gravity and good sense.
    </li>
    <li>Drizzle extra barbecue sauce over the pork like a sticky confession you’ll regret later.</li>
    <li>Heap on the purple cabbage slaw—tart, crunchy, and purple enough to offend the colour-blind.</li>
    <li>Cap with the top bun, pressing down just enough to threaten structural integrity.</li>
    <li>Flank with two dill pickle spears, standing like sarcastic bookends.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately, before the whole thing stages a delicious coup on your lap.</li>
  </ol>
