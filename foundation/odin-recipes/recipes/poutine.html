  <h1>Glorious Poutine</h1>

  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>Behold, the poutine: a cast-iron cauldron of golden fries, crisp as a winter morning, submerged beneath a gravy
    tsunami—rich, beefy, and unrepentantly glossy. Scattered like rogue snowdrifts are squeaky cheese curds, melting
    with the reluctance of a teenager asked to tidy their room. The whole steamy edifice squats on its wooden throne,
    daring you to resist its caloric coup d'état.</p>

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Golden fries (crisp enough to cut glass, hot from the fryer)</li>
    <li>Squeaky cheese curds (fresh, white, and mildly offended by heat)</li>
    <li>Beef gravy (velvety, dark, and plotting world domination)</li>
    <li>Cast-iron skillet (for dramatic presentation and third-degree burns)</li>
    <li>Pinch of audacity (serves four, or one with regret)</li>
    <li>Optional snow shovel (for portion control)</li>
  </ul>


  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Fry the chips until they’re golden and audacious, hot enough to make a snowman weep.</li>
    <li>Tumble them into the cast-iron skillet like contraband into a smuggler’s hold.</li>
    <li>Scatter cheese curds willy-nilly—fresh ones that squeak like a politician caught fibbing.</li>
    <li>Drown the lot in steaming beef gravy, poured with the abandon of a tabloid headline.</li>
    <li>Watch the curds surrender and wilt, forming molten white islands in a brown sea.</li>
    <li>Serve at once, before gravity or common sense intervenes.</li>
    <li>Eat with a fork, or abandon dignity and use the snow shovel.</li>
  </ol>
