  <h1>Glorious Tacos</h1>

  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>Behold, the humble taco: three crisp shells, folded with the precision of a valet parking a Bentley, cradling a
    riot of spiced beef mince that’s been persuaded into submission with cumin, chilli, and a whisper of garlic. Beneath
    lies a treacherous pool of molten cheese, oozing like gossip at a village fête, while shredded lettuce provides a
    crisp, green alibi for health. Atop it all, a jaunty crown of diced tomatoes—scarlet, pert, and utterly convinced of
    their own importance—perches with the smugness of a cat who’s knocked your vase off the mantel. The whole affair
    steams like a trio of smug volcanoes, quietly plotting to ruin your shirt and your diet in one delicious eruption.

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>3 crisp taco shells (the sumg upright kind)</li>
    <li>500g beef mince (spiced until it blushes)</li>
    <li>1 sachet of taco seasoning (the lazy chef's secret handshake)</li>
    <li>Handful of grated cheddar cheese (melts faster than your resolve)</li>
    <li>Shredded iceburg lettuce (green confetti for that guilt free crunch)</li>
    <li>2 ripe tomoatoes, diced (jaunty red pom-poms)</li>
    <li>A splash of lager (optional, for the chef)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Brown the beef mince in a hot pan until it’s crisply obedient, then stir in the taco seasoning with a splash
      of water; let it simmer like a sulky teenager for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Warm the taco shells in a low oven (or microwave if you’re in a hurry) until they’re toasty but not yet
      plotting rebellion.</li>
    <li>Spoon the spiced beef into each shell, dividing it with the fairness of a Tory MP sharing austerity.</li>
    <li>Blanket the beef with grated cheddar—generously, as if cheese were going out of fashion.</li>
    <li>Scatter shredded lettuce over the cheese like green ticker-tape at a very restrained parade.</li>
    <li>Crown each taco with diced tomatoes, arranging them with the smug precision of a window dresser.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately, before the volcanoes erupt and your shirt becomes a casualty.</li>
  </ol>
